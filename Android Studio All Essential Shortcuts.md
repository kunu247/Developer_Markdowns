#### In Android Studio on Windows, you can select multiple lines at once by holding down the **Alt** key and then clicking and dragging with the left mouse button. This action will allow you to create a rectangular selection, letting you select a column of text or multiple lines across the editor.

If you're looking to place multiple cursors for editing multiple lines simultaneously, you can do this by:

1. `Alt + Shift + Click`: Place additional cursors at each click point.
2. `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + J`: Select all occurrences of the word under the cursor to create multiple cursors.


These shortcuts are very handy for editing or adding text in multiple places at the same time.
