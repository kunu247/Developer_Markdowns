In SQL Server, the `WITH(NOLOCK)` statement is used to perform **dirty reads**, which means that it allows the query to read uncommitted data from other transactions. This is commonly used to avoid locking issues or improve performance when querying large tables, but it comes with certain risks.

### What Is a Lock?
In SQL Server, locks are used to maintain the consistency and integrity of data. When a query reads or modifies data, SQL Server places locks on the rows, pages, or tables being accessed. This prevents other transactions from modifying the same data simultaneously, ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent.

- **Shared Locks (S)**: Acquired during read operations (e.g., `SELECT`) to prevent data modification while the query is reading.
- **Exclusive Locks (X)**: Acquired during write operations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to prevent other queries from reading or modifying the data.

### What is `WITH(NOLOCK)`?
The `WITH(NOLOCK)` hint allows a query to **ignore locks** and read data that may be in the process of being changed by another transaction. This means the query doesn’t wait for locks to be released and can read rows that are being modified (uncommitted data), which might not be finalized yet. This can improve performance, especially for large tables, but there’s a risk of reading **dirty data** (inconsistent or inaccurate data).

### How to Use `WITH(NOLOCK)`?

You use `WITH(NOLOCK)` in a `SELECT` query to bypass locks. Here's the syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName WITH(NOLOCK);
```

### Example:
Let’s say you have a table `Orders` that is very large and is frequently updated. Normally, if you run a `SELECT` query on this table, your query may wait if there are locks due to ongoing `UPDATE` or `INSERT` operations.

```sql
-- Without NOLOCK
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate
FROM Orders;
```

If there are ongoing transactions modifying the `Orders` table, this query might wait until those transactions are finished, to ensure the data it reads is consistent.

Now, using `WITH(NOLOCK)`:

```sql
-- With NOLOCK
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate
FROM Orders WITH(NOLOCK);
```

This query will read the data without waiting for ongoing transactions to complete. It will ignore the locks placed by other queries, potentially improving the query’s speed.

### Key Characteristics of `WITH(NOLOCK)`:
- **Dirty Reads**: You might read data that hasn’t been committed yet. For example, if a row is being updated by another transaction but hasn’t been committed, your query might read the updated value even if the transaction is later rolled back.
- **Improved Performance**: Since the query doesn’t need to wait for locks to be released, it can improve performance, particularly for reporting or analytics on large tables.
- **No Locking Impact**: Using `WITH(NOLOCK)` ensures your query doesn’t place any additional locks on the data, allowing other transactions to proceed without interference.

### What is a Dirty Read?
A **dirty read** occurs when a query reads uncommitted data. This is data that is currently being modified by another transaction and might be rolled back (undone) later. If you read this uncommitted data, it’s possible that what you read could change or be invalid once the other transaction completes.

Here’s an example scenario of dirty reads:
1. Transaction A updates a row in the `Orders` table but hasn’t committed the transaction yet.
2. Transaction B uses `WITH(NOLOCK)` to read from the `Orders` table.
3. Transaction A rolls back the changes.
4. Transaction B read the uncommitted data from Transaction A, but the final data is different.

### Example of Dirty Read:
Imagine there’s a table `BankAccounts` where an update is happening to a particular account balance.

1. **Transaction A**:
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE BankAccounts
   SET Balance = Balance - 500
   WHERE AccountID = 123;
   -- Transaction A is still open and hasn't committed yet.
   ```

2. **Transaction B** (with `WITH(NOLOCK)`):
   ```sql
   SELECT AccountID, Balance
   FROM BankAccounts WITH(NOLOCK)
   WHERE AccountID = 123;
   ```

- Transaction B might see the balance as reduced by 500, even though Transaction A hasn't committed the change.
- If Transaction A is rolled back, the balance remains the same as before, but Transaction B already read the incorrect, uncommitted data.

### When to Use `WITH(NOLOCK)`:
1. **Non-Critical Queries**: Use `WITH(NOLOCK)` when you’re querying non-critical data where accuracy isn’t paramount (e.g., generating reports or doing analytics on data).
2. **Performance**: When you need to improve performance and avoid waiting for locks, especially on large tables.
3. **Real-Time Analytics**: In situations where you need to analyze data in real-time, and it's acceptable that the data may be slightly out of sync due to uncommitted changes.

### When NOT to Use `WITH(NOLOCK)`:
1. **Critical Data**: Don’t use `WITH(NOLOCK)` when data consistency and accuracy are essential, such as financial transactions, account balances, or legal records.
2. **Inconsistent Results**: Since you might read partially modified data, queries using `WITH(NOLOCK)` can return inconsistent or inaccurate results.
3. **Phantom Reads**: You may encounter **phantom reads**, where rows appear or disappear in your query result due to ongoing transactions.
4. **Data Corruption Risk**: For very critical operations, relying on potentially dirty data can lead to wrong decisions based on inaccurate information.

### Alternatives to `WITH(NOLOCK)`:
If you want better performance without the risks of dirty reads, you can consider:
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Similar to `WITH(NOLOCK)`, this isolation level allows reading uncommitted data at the session or transaction level.
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
    SELECT * FROM Orders;
    ```
- **SNAPSHOT Isolation**: A more robust isolation level that avoids dirty reads by using a version of the data as it was when the transaction began.
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT;
    SELECT * FROM Orders;
    ```
- **READ COMMITTED Snapshot Isolation (RCSI)**: A database-level setting that allows queries to read the last committed version of data, improving concurrency without dirty reads.

### Conclusion:
The `WITH(NOLOCK)` hint in SQL Server allows for non-blocking queries by ignoring locks, but it introduces the risk of reading dirty or uncommitted data. It can be useful in situations where performance is more important than absolute data accuracy, but it should be used with caution, especially in environments where data consistency is critical. For scenarios where you need accurate and up-to-date data, consider alternative methods like **Snapshot Isolation**.
