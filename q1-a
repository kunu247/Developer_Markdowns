Below is the explanation for the given concepts along with suitable examples. Each part is worth **6 marks**.

---

### (i) **Fixed-point Number Representation**
Fixed-point representation is a way to store real numbers in a computer by allocating a fixed number of bits for the integer part and the fractional part. Unlike floating-point representation, the decimal point is fixed and does not move.

#### Example:
- Assume a fixed-point representation with 8 bits:
  - 4 bits for the integer part.
  - 4 bits for the fractional part.
- The binary number `1101.0101`:
  - Integer part: `1101` = \( 13 \).
  - Fractional part: `0.0101` = \( 0.3125 \) (calculated as \( 1/4 + 1/16 \)).
  - Result: \( 13.3125 \).

Fixed-point numbers are used in systems like microcontrollers where hardware constraints favor simpler arithmetic.

---

### (ii) **Round-off Error**
Round-off error occurs when a number is approximated due to the limitations in precision of a computer's representation. Computers cannot represent all real numbers exactly due to finite memory, leading to small errors.

#### Example:
- Representing \( \frac{1}{3} \) in a computer with 5 decimal places:
  - Actual value: \( 0.33333\ldots \).
  - Stored value: \( 0.33333 \).
  - Round-off error: \( 0.00000\ldots + \ldots \).

This error can accumulate in iterative calculations, leading to significant inaccuracies in results.

---

### (iii) **Representation of Zero as a Floating-Point Number**
Floating-point numbers are represented using the **sign**, **exponent**, and **mantissa**. Zero is a special case and is represented by:
- **Sign**: 0 (positive zero) or 1 (negative zero).
- **Exponent**: All bits set to 0.
- **Mantissa**: All bits set to 0.

#### Example:
In IEEE 754 single-precision (32-bit):
- Positive zero: `0 00000000 00000000000000000000000`.
- Negative zero: `1 00000000 00000000000000000000000`.

While positive and negative zeros are mathematically equivalent, they may behave differently in certain operations, such as division.

---

### (iv) **Significant Digits in a Decimal Number Representation**
Significant digits are the meaningful digits in a number, representing its precision. This includes all non-zero digits and any zeros between them or trailing zeros in a decimal fraction.

#### Example:
- Number: \( 0.004560 \):
  - Significant digits: \( 4560 \) (4 digits: 4, 5, 6, 0).
  - Leading zeros are not counted.
- In scientific computations, significant digits determine the precision of a measurement or a result.

---

### (v) **Normalized Representation of a Floating-Point Number**
In normalized floating-point representation, the number is adjusted such that the leading digit (most significant bit) of the mantissa is non-zero (for binary, it is always 1). This ensures maximum precision for the given number of bits.

#### Example:
- Given: \( 0.00125 \) (in binary: `0.00101`).
  - Normalize: Shift decimal point to the right by 3 places.
  - Result: \( 1.01 \times 2^{-3} \).

Normalized representation is standard in floating-point formats like IEEE 754, where it optimizes storage and precision.

---

### (vi) **Overflow**
Overflow occurs when a number exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the chosen data type. This typically happens in fixed-size representations during arithmetic operations.

#### Example:
- In an 8-bit unsigned integer:
  - Maximum value: \( 2^8 - 1 = 255 \).
  - Adding \( 255 + 1 \):
    - Expected result: \( 256 \).
    - Actual result: \( 0 \) (due to wrap-around).

Overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and is a critical concern in systems like financial or safety-critical applications.
